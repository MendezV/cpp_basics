why cpp? fast code that performs well and controlls hardware directly in a very precise way

cpp is a compiled language, translate human readable into machine assembly code. 

c# and java are interpreted, the translation happens on runtime via a virtual machine.

book translation analogy

once compiled, the code runs in the platform in which it compiled without the need for further translation 

native does not equate to fast, cpp can be slower, need good code

structure 
	- basics
	- performance
	- memory, pointers
	- custom allocators, smart pointers, move schematics
	- templates, use them properly
	- macros
	- own data structures
	- low level optimization, compiler intrinsics in assembly, math in sse
